## Introduction

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing

### Data exploration

The dataset provided comprises of 6497 observations and 12 numerical variables. Each variable measures a different component of wine: fixed and volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, both free and total sulfur dioxide, density, the ph, sulphates, and alcohol. All these represents the features that will be used to classify the wine, while the target variable used will be 'quality'.

The distribution of the variables is overall skewed, as figure 1 depicts. Most of the observations tend to be on the lowest values of the range and around the mean, with the exception of 'total sulfur dioxide', 'ph', 'alcohol' and 'quality', which tend to be slightly more centered and spread.

```

Figure 2 gives another perspective on the distributions considered. Here it is possible to see better how observations tend to be around the mean in most cases, with the exception of the four cases highlighted before. Moreover, it is evident that in all variables there are potential outliers, which explains why in figure 1 most graphs are shifted on the left and not centered.

```

Finally, the correlation between the variables was investigated. The heath map in figure 3 shows that most variables are mildly correlated. There are two that stand out for their high value: 0.72 for free and total sulfur dioxide and -0.69 for density and alcohol. These two results can be justified using qualitative reasoning: in the first case the variables share the same object measured - sulfur dioxide; in the second case, chemically, ethanol (the element of alcohol) has a lower density compared to the water components of the wine, thus the negative relation. Focusing on the target, all the relations are negative and not strong, with the exception of 'alcohol' which has positive sign and medium strength.
